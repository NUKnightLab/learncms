 <p>
  So you've written some code, and after opening those files
  in your browser you are able to confirm that those files do
  indeed make a website. You're super excited to show all your
  friends and family, but how will other people see it? As of right
  now, those files are just living in a folder on your computer and it's
  not very practical to send all your website files to every person
  who wants to see it.
 </p>
 <p>
  What you need is a
  <glossary-term>
   server
  </glossary-term>
  , a special computer dedicated to
  housing your files and making sure that people can get
  them with a few keystrokes. In this lesson, we'll walk you through getting a URL, finding a hosting server, and publishing your site.

<step-block header="Purchase a domain name">
 <h3>
  What we do
 </h3>
 <p>
  We're getting you the URL of your dreams. Maybe. If it's still available.
 </p>
 <h3>
  Why we do
 </h3>
 <p>
  Every address on the web needs to be unique—that way users are sure they're getting the bona fide content they're looking for, and not a different site every time they request the same URL.
 </p>
 <h3>
  How we do
 </h3>
 <ol>
  <li>
   First, search for a domain name to see if it's
  available.
  Here are five popular services that offer domain
  names:
   <ul>
    <li>
     <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/" target="_blank">
      NameCheap
     </a>
    </li>
    <li>
     <a href="https://www.hover.com/" target="_blank">
      Hover
     </a>
    </li>
    <li>
     <a href="https://domains.google.com" target="_blank">
      Google Domains
     </a>
    </li>
    <li>
     <a href="http://www.1and1.com/" target="_blank">
      1&amp;1
     </a>
    </li>
    <li>
     <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/" target="_blank">
      GoDaddy
     </a>
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   Once you've got something good, pay up. You're purchasing ownership on a monthly or yearly basis. And you're buying the rights to the name—nothing more.
  </li>
 </ol>
</step-block>
<lesson-block header="Additional services">
 <p>
  These sites offer a lot of additional services that you
    don’t necessarily need. Don’t be tricked into buying anything
    you don’t need just because they sound fancy—domain
    registrars are businesses after all, and they’re looking to
    make money off of you. Here’s a list of common features that
    registrars often try to bundle with your domain. You can decide
    for yourself whether it sounds like you need it.
 </p>
 <dl>
  <dt>
   Hosting
  </dt>
  <dd>
   For a simple website, like a portfolio site or personal
        webpage, using the domain registrar’s hosting may be the
        simplest option. As you go on to develop bigger, more
        complex projects (especially those that require server-side
        scripts), you’ll probably want to look toward other hosting
        options.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   Local listing
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Listing a site locally makes it easier to find a website
        by putting it on search engines such as Yelp, GoogleMaps
        and FourSquare. If your website is for a business, local
        listing might be a good idea to attract new customers. It’s
        probably not your priority for a portfolio or personal
        site, but that’s up to you.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   Private Email
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Most domain registrars will offer email forwarding for
        free, which allows you to forward all emails sent to a
        specified address on your website to a pre-existing email
        account. This keeps everything centralized, you can
        continue to use whatever email provider you want, and you
        don’t have to pay a penny (or you shouldn’t, at least. If
        your domain registrar tries to make you pay for email
        forwarding, try looking elsewhere).
  </dd>
  <dt>
   Sub-domains
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Sub-domains come before your main domain name, such as
        shop.mydomain.com. These label different areas of your
        website, like an online store or blog. Many domain
        registrars allow you to register subdomains for free, but
        you’ll have to point or forward those domains to different
        websites as well.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   Positive SSL
  </dt>
  <dd>
   SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer, is the difference between
        http and https in front of a website’s URL. It's a way
        of encrypting websites so that everything sent between a
        client and the server your website is hosted on can’t be
        intercepted. If you’re collecting sensitive information on
        your website, like credit card information, you should
        invest in SSL.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   Website forwarding
  </dt>
  <dd>
   When you enter the URL www.newyorktimes.com into your browser, you're rerouted to the actual domain and website,
        www.nytimes.com. This is website forwarding. Forwarding ensures that commonly mistaken URLs will automatically go to the correct
        one, rather than giving the user a wrong or nonexistent
        page. Website forwarding is a good idea as your brand
        expands, especially if you are known by different names
        (such as an acronym). The kicker is, of course that you’ll have to
        purchase those other domains as well.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   WhoisGuard
  </dt>
  <dd>
   When you register a domain, you have to provide certain
        details about yourself, like your name and email address.
        This information is public and can easily be accessed by
        spammers through sites like who.is. WhoisGuard is a company
        that masks your personal information with their
        information, protecting you from spam.
  </dd>

<step-block header="Purchase a hosting server">
 <h3>
  What we do
 </h3>
 <p>
  A server hosts your website so that it is available and
  accessible on the Internet.
 </p>
 <h3>
  Why we do
 </h3>
 <p>
  These companies allow you, the client, to lease out space to publish your site onto the web on a monthly basis.
 </p>
 <h3>
  How we do
 </h3>
 <p>
  Servers work by uploading your files using a
  <glossary-term>
   File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
  </glossary-term>
  client so that all your code, images, and other files are readily accessible to each other.
 </p>
 <info-block emoji="👮" header="The host with the most">
  <p>
   Depending on the size of your website, you may have to sort
    through which hosting server is the best option for you. Most
    free hosting servers have limited services, will put ads on your site, and cannot host complex or large sites. Plus: virtually no customer service, since you're not a paying customer.
  </p>
 </info-block>
 <p>
  There are also free solutions to web hosting. One popular
  option is
  <a href="https://pages.github.com/">
   GitHub Pages
  </a>
  , which is perfect for hosting a one-page,
  static website like a personal website or a landing page. While
  you won’t have access to a server and therefore won’t be able to
  run any sort of server-side processes, it should be enough for a
  simple website. You can even set up your domain to point to your
  GitHub Page and mask the
  <glossary-term>
   DNS
  </glossary-term>
  to show your domain name.
 </p>
</step-block>
<step-block header="Connect your hosting server to your domain">
 <p>
  Once you’ve registered your domain name and purchased a
  hosting server, you will need to link the two in order for the
  URL to direct to the correct website. Most registrars lay out a
  clear process in connecting the domain name with the host, but in
  general you’ll just be pointing your domain name as the address
  to the IP address of the server where your files will be
  hosted.
 </p>
</step-block>
<step-block header="Connect to your host server">
 <p>
  In these steps, we’ll be assuming here that you’ll be logging
  into your server using SFTP, but if that’s not the case, you
  should look up a guide for whatever protocol you have on your
  server.
 </p>
 <p>
  In FileZilla, open the Site Manager by going to File &gt; Site
  Manager. This should bring up a window with a bunch of fields for
  you to fill out. The only things you need to make sure you have
  are the host (which is the IP address of the server you’re
  connecting to), the protocol, the logon type (which should be
  normal), and the user and password fields to your account. After
  filling out those fields, move over to the “Advanced” tab and in
  the Default remote directory field enter “/var/www/html.” This
  will just make it easier for you to get to the directory where
  you’ll be uploading your files. From here, you should be able to
  log in.

  In Cyberduck, when you launch the application for the first
  time you should see a set of pre-loaded bookmarks. You can go
  ahead and delete those – you’ll be adding your own bookmarks
  soon. Right-click on the screen and create a new bookmark, and
  you’ll be prompted to enter the information necessary to connect
  with the server. Fill out everything at the top of the screen,
  making sure not to check “Anonymous Login,” and then click “More
  Options.” In the “Path” field, enter “/var/www/html.” This will
  just make it easier for you to get to the directory where you’ll
  be uploading your files. Once you’ve done that, close out of that
  window and double-click on the bookmark you just made. Enter your
  password to connect to your server, and you should be in!

  In Cyberduck, once you’ve connected to your host server it
  should direct you to a new screen. Make sure that you’re in the
  /var/www/html directory, and from here you can just drag and drop
  your files from your computer into Cyberduck. Voila! That’s
  it!
