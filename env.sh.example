# This development-specific environment setup script should be sourced for
# local development to set the necessary settings keys. Reference it to your
# workon postactivate script for easy environment setup.

# This script also serves to document environment variables that will need to
# be set for deployment. Be sure all vars are set in this project's deploy yml
# files as the `init_env` structure. Ansible will write these vars out to
# a deployment specific script on the server. The deployment env script is
# used by Upstart as well as being sourced in the virtualenvironment when
# initiated via workon.
