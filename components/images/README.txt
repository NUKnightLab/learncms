Use this directory for images which help make the static HTML test pages for components usable.

DO NOT USE THIS DIRECTORY for images which are assets to make components work. Put those in /components/learn/images/...

In short, when components pull in any static materials, those materials should be in the same directory as the components or below them, because we need to be able to copy them as part of vulcanizing the various component files.
