                            <p>A text editor is a program that allows users to create and edit plain text files. Plain text files don&#8217;t have stylistic formatting; you won&#8217;t find code written in Comic Sans or Wingdings, which is one of the ways text editors are different from programs like Microsoft Word. Examples of free text editors include TextEdit and Notepad++. We recommend using <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">SublimeText</a>.</p>

                <step-block header="Getting organized: Boring but essential logistics">
                    <p>Setting up a work environment might seem like a hassle, but trust us--it will save you headaches down the road. Websites are essentially just a collection of files, so being organized will help prevent errors later on.</p>
                    <h3>What we do</h3>
                    <p>We're setting up a dedicated spot on your machine for all the files you'll create: your technical docs, as well as images, videos, or other assets you're going to display.</p>
                    <h3>Why we do</h3>
                    <p>Putting those files in organized folders enables us to give the browser exact directions to the locations of those files. So, no search or spotlight allowed&#8212;know where your files are so you can send the browser down the right path. Broken paths, missing files, or imprecise directions are common reasons things break. Ever seen a 404 message? That&#8217;s why!</p>
                    <h3>How we do</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create a new folder somewhere easy, like your desktop.</li>
                        <li>Give it a name with no spaces or caps.</li>
                        <li>Open up your text editor (probably Sublime if you're following along) and go to file &gt; new.</li>
                        <li>Then save it in your new folder as <code>index.html</code>. You <em>must</em> include the file extension! This is our first signal to the browser about what we'll be doing in here.</li>
                        <li>Head into your browser of choice (Chrome, cough cough), go to file &gt; open, and select the file we just made.</li>
                        <li>Take a look at your beautiful website? ...jk there's nothing there. That's good. Proceed!</li>

                        <p>If you're ever going to move your files around, make sure to close out of your text editor while you do. Poor Sublime will keep editing the old doc, and will keep saving it in the old place. Once again: close Sublime, move files, reopen to edit in Sublime.</p>

                        <glossary-term>HTML</glossary-term> is the backbone of the web, and the beginning of any website.

                    <p>If you make a lot of changes and then notice things are broken, it&#8217;s tough to tell what exactly broke, and when. So work in very small bursts.

You may be wondering. It's not just about how it looks (although that is a big part of it)&amp;#8212;it's also about how it functions. User interactivity is a huge component of web design, so it's time to start looking at ways to make your website reach its full potential. </lesson-ref>

(We like Cyberduck and FileZilla.) Make sure that your files appear on your server the same way that they do in the site folder on your computer, or else your site may not work properly.</lesson-ref>
                    <info-block header="Web Hosting">
                        <p>A server is a special computer dedicating to holding web files and making sure that people who ask to see your website get sent to the right place. Companies like BlueHost or Hover allow you to rent space on a server to publish your site. This is typically a more expensive service. Depending on the size of your website, you may have to sort through which hosting server is the best option for you. Most big hosting companies with free hosting servers will only provide limited services, put advertisements on your site, and cannot host complex or large sites. If you&#8217;re building something very small, though, like a personal portfolio site, there are a few good&#8212;and free!&#8212;options like Github Pages or Dropbox.</p>

If you have to fix something, change in on your computer, save, then re-upload the edited file onto your hosting server. Did we say good job yet? No? Good job!
